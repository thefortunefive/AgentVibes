## Step 4: Install Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop is the app where you'll talk to Claude with voice.

## Step 5: Configure AgentVibes in Claude Desktop

Now we'll tell Claude Desktop to use AgentVibes.

1. **Open the config file**:
   - Press `Windows Key + R`
   - Copy and paste this path:
     ```
     %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
     ```
   - Press Enter
   - If asked "How do you want to open this file?", choose "Notepad"

2. **Add AgentVibes configuration**:
   - If the file is empty or just has `{}`, replace everything with this:
     ```json
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "agentvibes": {
           "command": "npx",
           "args": ["-y", "agentvibes@beta", "agentvibes-mcp-server"]
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - If the file already has content, carefully add the `"agentvibes"` section inside `"mcpServers"`

3. **Save the file**:
   - Click "File" → "Save"
   - Close Notepad

## Step 6: Install Piper Voice System

Piper needs to be installed inside WSL for the free voices to work.

1. **Open PowerShell**

2. **Run the automated installer**:
   - Copy and paste this single command and press Enter:
     ```powershell
     wsl -e bash -c "curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpreibisch/AgentVibes/master/.claude/hooks/piper-installer.sh | bash"
     ```
   - The installer will:
     - Install pipx (if needed)
     - Install Piper TTS
     - Download a default voice (en_US-lessac-medium)
   - Wait for installation (2-3 minutes)

3. **When prompted** "Would you like to download voice models now?":
   - Type `y` and press Enter
   - This downloads the free voice model

4. **Installation complete!**
   - You should see "🎉 Piper TTS Setup Complete!"

---

## Step 7: Start Using AgentVibes!

1. **Open Claude Desktop**

2. **Wait for setup** (first time only):
   - The first time, AgentVibes MCP server needs to start (10-20 seconds)
   - You'll see a small notification when it's ready

3. **Test it**:
   - Type: `What AgentVibes tools do you have?`
   - Claude should list tools like `text_to_speech`, `list_voices`, etc.

4. **Hear your first voice**:
   - Type: `Use text to speech to say "Hello, I'm using AgentVibes!"`
   - You should hear audio! 🎉
