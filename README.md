## 🎙️ AgentVibes MCP

Agent Vibes was originally created to give the Claude Code assistant a voice! Simply install it with an npx command in your terminal, and Claude Code can talk back to you.

We've now enhanced this capability by adding an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This integration exposes Agent Vibes' functionality directly to your AI assistant, allowing you to configure and control Agent Vibes using natural language instead of typing "/" slash commands.

Setting it up is straightforward: just add the MCP server to your Claude Code configuration files.

But the convenience doesn't stop there. With the MCP server in place, Claude Desktop can now use Agent Vibes too! We've even tested it successfully with Warp, an AI assistant that helps you navigate Windows and other operating systems.

We're thrilled about this expansion because it means Claude Desktop and Warp can finally talk back as well!

If you decide to use the MCP server on Claude Desktop, after configuration, give Claude Desktop this command: "every time i give you a command, speak the acknowledgement using agentvibes and the confirmation about what you completed, when done"—and watch the magic happen!

**🎯 Control AgentVibes with natural language - no slash commands to remember!**

Just say "Switch to Aria voice" or "Speak in Spanish" instead of typing commands.

**Works in:** Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Warp Terminal

## 🎭 Personalities vs Sentiments

**Two ways to add personality to Claude's voice:**

### 🎪 Personalities (Voice + Style)
Changes **both** voice AND how Claude talks. Each personality has a dedicated voice.

**Examples:** `sarcastic`, `pirate`, `grandpa`, `flirty`, `zen`, `robot`

```bash
/agent-vibes:personality pirate       # Uses Pirate Marshal voice + pirate speak
```

### 💭 Sentiments (Style Only)
Applies personality style to **your current voice** without changing it.

```bash
/agent-vibes:switch Aria              # Set voice
/agent-vibes:sentiment sarcastic      # Add sarcasm to Aria
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Personality** = Changes voice + style
- **Sentiment** = Keeps your voice + adds style

## 🔊 Remote Audio Setup

**Running AgentVibes on a remote server but want to hear TTS on your local machine?**

We've got you covered! AgentVibes now includes **automatic SSH audio tunnel detection and optimization** for seamless remote audio playback.

### 🎯 Automatic SSH Audio Optimization (v2.0.17+)

**NEW:** AgentVibes automatically detects SSH sessions and optimizes audio for remote playback!

**What it does:**
- ✅ **Auto-detects** remote SSH sessions (VS Code Remote SSH, regular SSH, cloud environments)
- ✅ **Auto-converts** audio to 48kHz stereo WAV format for SSH tunnel compatibility
- ✅ **Eliminates static/clicking** sounds that occur with default audio formats
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - works out of the box

**How it works:**
1. AgentVibes checks for SSH environment variables (`SSH_CONNECTION`, `SSH_CLIENT`, `VSCODE_IPC_HOOK_CLI`)
2. If detected, it converts ElevenLabs audio (44.1kHz mono MP3) to 48kHz stereo WAV
3. Audio plays clearly through your SSH tunnel without static or distortion

**Supported scenarios:**
- 🖥️ **VS Code Remote SSH** - Code from local VS Code, run TTS on remote server
- 🔐 **Regular SSH** - Standard SSH connections with audio tunneling
- ☁️ **Cloud Dev Environments** - AWS, Azure, GCP instances with SSH access
