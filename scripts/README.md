# AgentVibes Setup Scripts

This directory contains setup scripts to help you configure AgentVibes and related features.

## Remote Audio Setup

These scripts help you set up audio playback from a remote Linux server to your local Windows machine. This is useful when running AgentVibes on a remote server but wanting TTS announcements to play on your local speakers.

### Scripts

#### `setup-remote-audio.sh` (Linux/Remote Server)

Configures PulseAudio on your remote Linux server to forward audio through an SSH tunnel.

**Requirements:**
- Linux system with bash
- PulseAudio installed
- SSH access

**Usage:**
```bash
# Download and run
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpreibisch/AgentVibes/master/scripts/setup-remote-audio.sh
chmod +x setup-remote-audio.sh
./setup-remote-audio.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Configures PulseAudio to accept network connections
- Sets up the `PULSE_SERVER` environment variable
- Creates backups of existing configurations
- Provides verification steps

#### `setup-windows-audio.ps1` (Windows/Local Machine)

Configures your Windows SSH client to create the audio tunnel to the remote server.

**Requirements:**
- Windows 10/11
- WSL2 with GUI support (WSLg)
- OpenSSH Client
- PowerShell 5.1 or later

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Download
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpreibisch/AgentVibes/master/scripts/setup-windows-audio.ps1" -OutFile "setup-windows-audio.ps1"

# Run as Administrator (recommended)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\setup-windows-audio.ps1 -RemoteHost "your-server-ip-or-hostname"
```

**Optional Parameters:**
- `-RemoteUser <username>` - SSH username (defaults to current Windows user)
- `-TunnelPort <port>` - Audio tunnel port (default: 14713)
- `-SSHConfigPath <path>` - Custom SSH config location

**Examples:**
```powershell
# Basic usage
.\setup-windows-audio.ps1 -RemoteHost "192.168.1.100"

# With custom username and port
.\setup-windows-audio.ps1 -RemoteHost "myserver.com" -RemoteUser "ubuntu" -TunnelPort 24713
```

**What it does:**
- Creates SSH configuration with RemoteForward tunnel
- Verifies WSL and OpenSSH installation
- Backs up existing SSH config
- Provides testing and verification steps

## Setup Order

1. **First**: Run `setup-windows-audio.ps1` on your local Windows machine
2. **Then**: Run `setup-remote-audio.sh` on your remote Linux server
3. **Finally**: Reconnect via SSH and test audio

#### `fix-audio-tunnel.sh` (NEW - WSL or Remote Server)

**The easiest way to fix audio tunnel issues!**

Auto-detects environment and runs appropriate fixes for stale SSH processes, stopped socat bridges, and connection issues.

**Requirements:**
- Run from WSL (for complete fix) OR ubuntu-rdp (for local fix)
- SSH access configured
- sudo privileges for killing processes

**Usage:**
```bash
# From WSL - runs complete fix
./scripts/fix-audio-tunnel.sh

# From ubuntu-rdp - runs local fix
./scripts/fix-audio-tunnel.sh
```

**What it does (when run from WSL):**
1. ✅ Kills stale SSH processes on ubuntu-rdp holding port 14713
2. ✅ Restarts socat bridge on WSL if needed
3. ✅ Kills local stale SSH tunnels
4. ✅ Creates fresh SSH tunnel to ubuntu-rdp
5. ✅ Tests audio connection
6. ✅ Provides clear status and usage instructions

**What it does (when run from ubuntu-rdp):**
1. ✅ Kills local processes using port 14713
2. ✅ Waits for tunnel to be re-established
3. ✅ Tests audio connection
4. ✅ Plays test tone through Windows speakers

**When to use:**
- Audio stopped working suddenly
- Getting "Connection refused" errors
- SSH shows "Warning: remote port forwarding failed"
- speaker-test fails
- AgentVibes TTS not playing through Windows speakers

#### `check-audio-tunnel.sh` (Diagnostic)

Checks audio tunnel status without making changes. Useful for verifying setup or diagnosing issues.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/check-audio-tunnel.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Fix

**If audio stopped working**, run this first:
```bash
# From WSL
./scripts/fix-audio-tunnel.sh
```

This will automatically fix the most common issues:
- Stale SSH processes blocking port 14713
- Stopped socat bridge
- Conflicting SSH tunnels

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: "Warning: remote port forwarding failed for listen port 14713"**

**Symptom:** SSH tunnel fails to establish
**Cause:** Old SSH sessions left zombie processes holding port 14713
**Fix:** `./scripts/fix-audio-tunnel.sh` (kills stale processes automatically)

**Issue 2: "Connection refused" / "ALSA lib pulse.c: Unable to connect"**

**Symptom:** Audio playback fails
**Cause:** socat bridge on WSL stopped running
**Fix:** `./scripts/fix-audio-tunnel.sh` (restarts socat automatically)

**Issue 3: Audio works intermittently**

**Symptom:** Audio plays sometimes but not always
**Cause:** Multiple SSH sessions creating conflicting tunnels
**Fix:** `./scripts/fix-audio-tunnel.sh` (kills all tunnels and creates one clean tunnel)

### Manual Diagnostics

If the automated fix doesn't work, try these manual checks:

**Check socat bridge (WSL):**
```bash
wsl ss -tlnp | grep 14713
# Expected: LISTEN 0 5 *:14713 *:* users:(("socat"...))
```

**Check SSH tunnel (ubuntu-rdp):**
```bash
ssh ubuntu-rdp 'netstat -tlnp | grep 14713'
# Expected: tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:14713 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN
```

**Find stale processes:**
```bash
ssh ubuntu-rdp 'sudo lsof -i :14713'
# Should show only one sshd process
```

**Test audio:**
```bash
ssh ubuntu-rdp
export PULSE_SERVER=tcp:localhost:14713
speaker-test -t sine -f 1000 -l 1
```

**Detailed troubleshooting guide:** See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for in-depth analysis of recent issues and their solutions.

### Legacy Issues

**Audio doesn't play:**
- Ensure WSL is updated: `wsl --update`
- Restart WSL: `wsl --shutdown`
- Verify SSH tunnel: `ssh -v your-host`

**Connection refused:**
- Check SSH config has `RemoteForward 14713 localhost:14713`
- Verify you're connected via SSH
- Check firewall settings

**PulseAudio errors:**
- Restart PulseAudio: `pulseaudio --kill && pulseaudio --start`
- Check environment: `echo $PULSE_SERVER`
- Verify config: `pactl info`
