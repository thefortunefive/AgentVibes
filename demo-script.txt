Welcome to AgentVibes! Hopefully this will make your time with Claude even more fun.

To get started, make sure you set your output style to agent-vibes. That's step one. Use slash output-style agent-vibes.

Also, don't forget to get yourself an ElevenLabs API key and export it to your environment in your bashrc or zshrc file. Restart Claude and you're ready to go.

One fun command is to change the personality. I recommend the sarcastic personality. Let me demonstrate four different personalities for you.


Have fun exploring all the different personalities and voices in AgentVibes!
